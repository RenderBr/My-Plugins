# A list of all my custom plugins
All of these plugins are currently confirmed working by me. I have either used them, or am currently using them. Abandoned plugins may no longer work, however as I will not be updating these.

## Supported & Actively Maintained
- [Appointer](https://github.com/RenderBr/Appointer) - a playtime based rankup system, plus an AFK system (rewritted TimeRanks/RankSystem)
- [AVRelay](https://github.com/RenderBr/AV-Relay) - Discord <-> Terraria bridge (Discord.NET)
- [Banker](https://github.com/RenderBr/Banker) - a simple economy plugin, integrates with Appointer (rewritten SEConomy/SimpleEcon)
- [Connector](https://github.com/RenderBr/MultiServerChat) - an updated & improved multi-server chat fork
- [Prizes](https://github.com/Terraria-Builders-Community/Prizes) - vote rewards & chat games
- [Supplier](https://github.com/RenderBr/Supplier) - infinite chests redone
- [TileWatch](https://github.com/RenderBr/TileWatch) - [WIP] History rebuilt from the ground up (tile monitoring/history, tile rollbacks, more)
- [tShockAutoBC](https://github.com/Average-Org/tShockAutoBC) - Autobroadcast / Command Trigger plugin

## Not fully mine, but plugins I actively maintain
- [AdvancedWarplates](https://github.com/RenderBr/AdvancedWarpplates) - modified advancedwarplates, allows server/dimensional teleporation
- [Dimensions](https://github.com/RenderBr/Dimensions-TerrariaServer) - required for Dimensions, updated for TShock v5 and Terraria 1.4.4.x
- [Diemob](https://github.com/RenderBr/DieMob) - kills mobs in regions automatically
- [History](https://github.com/RenderBr/History) - old-skool tile monitoring and rollback plugin

### On hold? Idk... not a priority
- [TerrariaFortress](https://github.com/RenderBr/TerrariaFortress) - class and team based pvp server gamemode - haven't worked on this in a while

### Discontinued / Low-effort support
- [AVoteRewards](https://github.com/Average-Org/AVote-Rewards) - my old and dependency-less plugin, works as intended and still a good option if you want something simple
- [SimpleEcon](https://github.com/Average-Org/SimpleEcon) - my previous attempt at a SEconomy replacement, now superceded by Banker
- [RankSystem](https://github.com/Average-Org/RankSystem) - my original attempt at a TimeRank rewrite, now superceded by Appointer

### Abandoned
- [AverageTerraria](https://github.com/RenderBr/AverageTerrariaMain) - Average Terraria's Freebuild and Survival base plugins. Implemented a lot of functionality for my server (RIP my baby)
- [TimeRanks](https://github.com/RenderBr/TimeRanks) - bippity's TimeRanks rewritten/refactored
